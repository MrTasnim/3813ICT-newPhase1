# Basic Overview
The chat system allows users to communicate with each other in real-time within different groups 
and channels. There are three levels of permissions on the site.   
1. Super Admin  
2. Group Admin  
3. User  
The solution is implemented using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) along 
with sockets.io and Peer.js.
